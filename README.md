This repository is built for showcasing the completion of task given by Tayyari.
I've added an api endpoint from which we can add question along with its 4 options, answer, answer Image and explanation.
Backend also has an api to fetch all the question from the database, for database i've used MongoDB and for storing answer image i've used cloudinary.
This shows my skills in not only frontend but also in handling apis of backend.
In Frontend , I've used react's inbuilt useReducer for managing global state among various components as well as to maintain consistency .

Thanks and Regards,
Vishal Khurana :)
