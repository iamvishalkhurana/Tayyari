This repository is built for showcasing the completion of task given by Tayyari.
I've added an api endpoint from which we can add question along with its 4 options, answer, answer Image and explanation.
This shows my skills in not only frontend but also in handling apis of backend.
In Frontend , I've used react's inbuilt useReducer for managing global state among various components as well as to maintain consistency .

Thanks and Regards,
Vishal Khurana :)
